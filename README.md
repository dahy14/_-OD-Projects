# _-OD-Projects
I will upload a one day project each day until I get a work,
there may be unfinished projects, because after a day 
I will leave that project to start new one.

The projects may be HTML,CSS,JavaScript, Python Script, a side game, 
or any other thing. 

All the works on this repository are my own implementation,
but if not i wll give credit to where it is due. 
Likewise if you find something interesting here, 
you are free to use them with all your moral principles.
